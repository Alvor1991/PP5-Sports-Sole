### Structure

#### Flowchart

The website is organized using a [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) Flowchart to illustrate the user journey and interactions, ensuring intuitive navigation and a seamless user experience. The chart outlines the interactions available to both logged-in and logged-out users, illustrating how they navigate through the site's features.
