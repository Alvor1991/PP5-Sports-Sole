#### Kanban board

GitHub Projects was used as a project management tool with a Kanban board to track these user stories and monitor progress. **Story points** were assigned to these user stories, using the Fibonacci sequence (3, 5, 8) to represent the relative complexity and effort involved in each task:

**Start**
