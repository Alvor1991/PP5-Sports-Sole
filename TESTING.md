## Code Validation

### HTML

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) service was used to validate the HTML code of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors.

W3C Markup Validator found the following errors in `base.html`:

![base.html validation errors image](assets/testing_files/base_html_error1.png)

![base.html validation errors image](assets/testing_files/base_html_error2.png)

Warning: The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources.
Fix: Removed type="text/javascript" from all script tags (HTML5 default).

Error: The aria-labelledby attribute must point to an element in the same document.
Fix: Updated the id of Women’s to "womens-link" and Men’s to "mens-link" to match aria-labelledby.

Warning: Possible misuse of aria-label.
Fix: Removed aria-label from dropdowns since aria-labelledby already handles accessibility.

Warning: The first occurrence of ID user-options was here.
Fix: Renamed the duplicate id="user-options" to id="user-options-mobile" in the mobile navigation.

Warning: Possible misuse of aria-label.
Fix: Removed aria-label="Search" from "fas fa-search" as it is unnecessary for purely decorative icons.

W3C Markup Validator found the following errors in `treatments.html`:

![treatments.html validation errors image](assets/testing_files/treatment_errors.png)

* To resolve the error, I wrapped content with a div instead of p and removed redundant closing tags. 

### CSS

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) service was used to validate the CSS code of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors.

W3C CSS Validator found no errors or warnings in the CSS.

![CSS validation image](assets/testing_files/css_validation.png)

### Python

[PEP8CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to validate the Python code for PEP8 compliance. As there were many files to assess within each app, I have focused on the appointment app for this testing section. 

| Location | Errors / Warnings | Code Reviewed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ./appointments/model.py | ![forms.py errors/warnings image](assets/testing_files/appointment_model.png) | ![forms.py code reviewed image](assets/testing_files/models_reviewed.pmg.png) |
| ./appointments/views.py | ![views.py errors/warnings image](assets/testing_files/appointments_views.png) | ![views.py code reviewed image](assets/testing_files/views_reviewed.png) |
| ./appointments/forms.py | ![urls.py errors/warnings image](assets/testing_files/appointments_forms.png) | ![urls.py code reviewed image](assets/testing_files/forms_reviewed.pmg.png) |


### JavaScript

[JSHint's JavaScript Code Quality Tool](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the site's JavaScript code.

During development, I encountered errors related to the use of ES6 features, such as const, arrow functions, and template literals, which were flagged by environments expecting older JavaScript versions.

Despite these errors, I chose to stick with ES6 as it offers a more modern and readable syntax, improving code maintainability. The project targets modern browsers, which fully support ES6, allowing for better performance & alignment with current web development practices.

## Accessibility

Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools was used to confirm that colors & fonts used throughout the website are easy to read and accessible.
